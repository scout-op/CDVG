## Abstract
Remote sensing change detection aims to perceive changes occurring on the Earth’s surface from remote sensing data in different periods, and feed these changes back to humans. 
However, most existing methods only focus on detecting change regions, lacking the ability to interact with users to identify changes that the users expect. 
In this paper, we introduce a new task named Change Detection Question Answering and Grounding (CDQAG), which extends the traditional change detection task by providing interpretable textual answers and intuitive visual evidence. 
To this end, we construct the first CDQAG benchmark dataset, termed QAG-360K, comprising over 360K triplets of questions, textual answers, and corresponding high-quality visual masks.
It encompasses 10 essential land-cover categories and 8 comprehensive question types, which provides a large-scale and diverse dataset for remote sensing applications. 
Based on this, we present VisTA, a simple yet effective baseline method that unifies the tasks of question answering and grounding by delivering both visual and textual answers.
Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on both the classic CDVQA and the proposed CDQAG datasets. 
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental results provide useful insights for the development of better CDQAG models, and we hope that our work can inspire further research in this important yet underexplored direction.
